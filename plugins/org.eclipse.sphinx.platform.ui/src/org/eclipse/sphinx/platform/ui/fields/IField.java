 * <b><em>Sphinx Platform Field </em></b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A platform field is made of several controls (i.e. widgets such as: <em>label</em>, <em>text</em>, <em>combo</em>,
 * <em>button</em>, <em>list</em>, etc.). From the association of such controls result a field whose behavior is
 * specialized according to the widgets it owns. The field content creation is supposed to be performed inside method
 * <tt>fillIntoGrid</tt> that must be implemented by every field.
 * <p>
 * Every field contains at least a label; this label displays a text that is owned by the field. This interface provides
 * methods allowing: to set the text of this label control, to set the tool tip of this label control, or to get this
 * label control.
 * <p>
 * A platform field may have listeners that can be added or removed thanks to methods provided by this interface. Inside
 * concrete implementation of this interface, it is recommended to use a listener list (<tt>ListenerList</tt>) in order
 * to store listeners associated to this field.
 * 
 * @see org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label
 * @see org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList
