/**
 * An enhanced {@link TreeIterator tree iterator} for tree content that provides the capability to detect cyclic tree
 * paths. Cyclic tree paths are sequences of repeated child items that refer to the same underlying objects. If such
 * repeated tree paths are encountered, the tree iteration is {@link #prune prune}ed at the first recurrent child item
 * to avoid that all remaining repeated child items are - potentially infinitely - re-traversed. Additionally, the
 * {@link #isRecurrent()} method enables the caller to get to know if the current tree item (i.e., the tree item
 * returned by the last call to {@link #next()}) is recurrent or not.
 *
 * @see #prune()
 * @see #isRecurrent()
