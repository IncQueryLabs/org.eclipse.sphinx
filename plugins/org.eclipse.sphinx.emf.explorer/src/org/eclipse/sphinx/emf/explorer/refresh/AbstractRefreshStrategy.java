/**
 * Represents a refresh operation on a JFace {@link Viewer viewer} that follows some specific strategy. Optionally
 * records the underlying viewer's expansion and selection state before the refresh operation and restored it
 * thereafter.
 * <p>
 * Clients are supposed to subclass this class and implement its {@link #refresh(Viewer)} method. In the most simple
 * case, this can be done by just invoking {@link Viewer#refresh()}. However, the main purpose of this class is to
 * enable clients to implement a some more sophisticated logic that performs a selective refresh of the viewer items
 * that are actually need to be refreshed which can save a lot of runtime-performance in many situations.
